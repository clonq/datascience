Linear Algebra
===

`Linear algebra` is the is the math of vectors and matrices.

The main structures of linear algebra are vector spaces.

A `vector space` or `linear space` is a collection of objects called vectors.

A `scalar` is a real number i.e. a value that represents a quantity along a continuous line. 

The operations we can perform on vectors are addition, subtraction, scaling, norm (length), dot product, and cross product.

The mathematical operations defined for matrices are: addition, subtraction, matrix product, matrix inverse, matrix transpose, matrix trace, determinant.

A special case of the matrix-matrix product, the multiplication of a matrix by a vector produces a column vector with coefficients equal to the dot products of rows of the matrix with the vector.
