Linear Algebra
===

`Linear algebra` is the is the math of vectors and matrices.

The main structures of linear algebra are vector spaces.

A `vector space` or `linear space` is a collection of objects called vectors.

A `scalar` is a real number i.e. a value that represents a quantity along a continuous line. 

The operations we can perform on vectors are addition, subtraction, scaling, norm (length), dot product, and cross product.

The mathematical operations defined for matrices are: addition, subtraction, matrix product, matrix inverse, matrix transpose, matrix trace, determinant.

A special case of the matrix-matrix product, the multiplication of a matrix by a vector produces a column vector with coefficients equal to the dot products of rows of the matrix with the vector.

A `basis` for a n-dimensional vector space S is any set of n linearly independent vectors that are part of S.

A set of vectors is said to be linearly dependent if one of the vectors in the set can be defined as a linear combination of the other vectors. If no vector in the set can be written in this way, then the vectors are said to be `linearly independent`.

The coordinate space R<sup>n</sup> forms an n-dimensional vector space over the field of real numbers with the addition of the structure of linearity.

`Linearity` or `linear map` or `linear function` is a function that is both additive and first degree homogeneous.

An `additive function`, `additive map` or `Z-linear map` is a function that preserves the addition operation ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/f/d/afdbe27ae964f8feabec2ce7f438e585.png) for any two elements x and y in the domain.

A `homogeneous function` is a function with multiplicative scaling behaviour: if the argument is multiplied by a factor, then the result is multiplied by some power of this factor:

If ƒ : V → W is a function between two vector spaces over a field F, and k is an integer, then ƒ is said to be homogeneous of degree k if:

A `field` is any set of elements that satisfies the field axioms (associativity, commutativity, distributivity, identity and inverse) for both addition and multiplication and is a commutative division algebra.

A `first degree homogeneous` function is expressed as:
